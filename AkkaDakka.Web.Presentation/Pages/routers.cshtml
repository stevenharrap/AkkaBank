<ul>
    <li>We want the actors to spread wide and have lots of children.</li>
    <li>We want to let Akka decide how many children is allowable and how long they should exist.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Welcome to routing!</h2>
<ul>
    <li>There are several types of routers - here are two useful types.</li>
    <li>Routers are a special kind of Actor that is supplied by Akka - still just actors but with special powers.</li>
    <li>Routers create many child Actors of a given type (e.g a AccountActorRouter makes many AccountActors).</li>
    <li>Pass your messages onto your router and let it sort out the details.</li>
</ul>
